# KeyAuthSellerAPI-batch

**KeyAuth Seller API ... in a batch file** Yes... keyauth seller api in a batch file lol, hope you enjoy. It's pretty straight forward and very easy to edit if you need too, if for whatever reason you need help, just let me know...   

**How do I run it? ... it keeps closing :angry:  ** Create a .txt file on your desktop called "sellerkey", if you do not have this file, it will not start the program... if you do **not** want it to save your seller key to a text file, go to line 6 and replace it with `set /p sellerkey=` then delete line 8.  

This is a very basic setup... and was simply put together to make seller api access faster lol. Enjoy, or don't  but it's here if want.


Remember DO NOT SHARE YOUR SELLER KEY WITH ANYONE! IT CAN GET YOU BANNED ON KEYAUTH! PROTECT IT!!!
